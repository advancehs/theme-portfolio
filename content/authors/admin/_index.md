I am a Ph.D. student specializing in World Economics, with a research focus on efficiency and productivity analysis, global value chains, and the CEG model. I have published 13 high-quality papers in renowned academic journals such as "Energy Economics," "Energy," and "Applied Energy."

In my research, I am dedicated to exploring and addressing critical issues in the global energy and economic domains. By applying economic and data analysis techniques, I investigate the efficiency and productivity levels across different industries, as well as the dynamic evolution of global value chains. My research also delves into the CEG model, aiming to deepen the understanding of the impact of energy and environmental policies on economic development and sustainability.

I am passionate about exploring new frontiers and challenging myself, and I actively engage in collaborations with experts from diverse fields to foster research innovation. My goal is to contribute to the global economics community, provide empirical foundations for policymakers, and strive towards achieving sustainable development goals.

I look forward to collaborating with colleagues from around the world to drive advancements and innovations in the field of economics.
